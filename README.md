# Driver signup modeling and prediction

The main objective of the project is to find which driver signups are mostly likely to start driving and important factors that determine the same. To achieve this I have used data mining and machine learning techiniques.

The project is in jupyter notebook format which is convenient to run scripts, visualize data, and write comments; making it a complete report ready for presentation. I have added comments in the file itself by keeping the readme file short

Questions, comments, and feedbacks are appreciated. Please send it pappakrishnan.venkatesh@gmail.com
